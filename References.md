Homo Ludens – 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens)

“The judge's wig, however, is more than a mere relic of antiquated professional dress. Functionally it has close connections with the dancing masks of savages. It transforms the wearer into another "being". And it is by no means the only very ancient feature which the strong sense of tradition so peculiar to the British has preserved in law. The sporting element and the humour so much in evidence in British legal practice is one of the basic features of law in archaic society.[23]”

Why should man expect his prayer for mercy to be heard by What is above him when he shows no mercy to what is under him?
