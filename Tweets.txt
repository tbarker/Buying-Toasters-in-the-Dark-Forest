No one will buy a toaster in the dark forest. There is no crypto law; itâ€™s a nonsense. Order emerges from the human play instincts, and we have to build regtech from gametech. Itâ€™s all the same thing.

This is thread version of an 8000 (!) word essay Iâ€™ve been preparing for over a year. And frankly none of you are likely to read it, so itâ€™s staying as a rough draft for now ðŸ™‚

People have committed far worse transgressions than the average DeFi hacker within EVE Online and other MMORGs, but we never prosecute them. For some reason, Pancake tokens and FartCoin, are "real", but ISK in-game currency isn't.

But even if the legal system occasionally intrudes, the "Dark Forest" nature of crypto creates an environment where actions have unpredictable consequences, rules are opaque, and players do not agree on what is fair.

Creating useful "autonomous worlds" in crypto, requires our games to be structured with clean boundaries, consistent enforcement, and appropriate embedding within wider social contexts.
